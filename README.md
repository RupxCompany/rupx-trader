### Stock Finder

This could be an entry point to our trading where we analyze the market trends to find the best stocks to trade on

For short-term trading with a maximum duration of about a month, you might consider a strategy that combines elements of momentum trading with technical analysis. Here's a simple yet effective strategy to identify potentially profitable stocks for short-term trades:

#### Step 1: Stock Selection Criteria

Start by setting some basic criteria to filter stocks that are suitable for short-term trading:

1. High Liquidity:

   Choose stocks with high trading volume to ensure that you can enter and exit trades easily without significantly impacting the price.
2. Volatility:

   Look for stocks with a high degree of volatility, as they present more opportunities for profit in short-term trading.
3. Market Cap:

  Focus on mid-cap and large-cap stocks, which tend to offer a good balance between stability and potential for significant price movements.

#### Step 2: Technical Indicators

Use a combination of technical indicators to identify the current momentum and possible entry points:

1. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):
 Use MACD to identify changes in momentum, direction, and duration of a stock's price trend. A bullish crossover (when the MACD crosses above its signal line) can be used as a buy signal, and a bearish crossover (when the MACD crosses below) as a sell signal.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): 
RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. Generally, an RSI above 70 might indicate that a stock is overbought (potential sell signal), whereas an RSI below 30 might indicate that a stock is oversold (potential buy signal).
3. Bollinger Bands:
These can help you understand the volatility and price levels relative to previous trades. A stock price touching or crossing the lower Bollinger Band could be seen as a buying opportunity, whereas touching or crossing the upper band might be a selling point if confirmed with other indicators.

#### Step 3: Momentum Screening

Look for stocks showing strong momentum. This can be determined by stocks hitting new highs or lows, stocks breaking out above resistance levels, or stocks that are consistently performing better than the market over a short period, like the past week or month.
